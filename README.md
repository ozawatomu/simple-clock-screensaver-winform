# Simple Clock Screensaver using Winform

<img src="demo_screenshot.png" width="1200" alt="Program Demo Screenshot">

This project is the same application as my [Simple Clock Screensaver Pygame](https://github.com/ozawatomu/simple-clock-screensaver-pygame) application but is written on the .NET Framework using Windows Forms instead of Python. The benefit of this is that it creates a native executable file rather than a python program bundled as an executable. This increases performance. Yes, this simple application will show no difference with this new performance boost. The point of this then was to grow my understanding of developing a Windows Forms app for my upcoming projects.
